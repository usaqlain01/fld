He ascended to the Qin throne at age 13, amid the chaos and conflict of the Warring States period (475-221 BC). Seven major states fought for regional dominance, resulting in centuries of bloody conflict.</p><p>Lacquered leather armor, similar to the ceremonial stone version seen above, would have been a constant part of the First Emperor’s life throughout this time of ceaseless warfare.</p><p>Before age 40, Qin Shihuangdi conquered the last of his rivals and brought the Warring States period to an end. He began to commission his own enormous defensive walls and worked to unite the peoples of his empire for the first time through a common writing system, standardized currency, and a unified system of measurements.These shared cultural bonds, forged by his empire, helped hold the country we now know as China together for more than 2,000 years.</p></div><figure> <img src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/terracotta/tcw-buckle-1x-a540af23b91999979aa5cc5d42c22443.jpg" alt="Gold Buckle" /> <figcaption>This gold belt hook was recovered from a tomb belonging to one of the dukes of the Qin state. The artifact predates Emperor Qin Shihuang by approximately 300 years, and is an example of the ancient custom of burying the dead with important funerary objects for the afterlife. The presence of gold and other treasures in a tomb demonstrated the wealth and power of the owner. Qin Shihuangdi’s tomb reflected that tradition, but on a scale never seen before or since.</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>The Warring States Period was a time when warfare in China increased and peasants were drafted into the armies.

Time and looters ravaged the soldiers, turning the once-proud army into a distant memory. That all changed in 1974, when a farmer happened to unearth these mysterious soldiers.</p><p>A farmer in Shaanxi Province stumbled upon a terracotta statue while digging a well and revealed a major archaeological find. Today, archaeologists continue to explore the site and its history. Researchers estimate that there are about 8,000 warriors at the site. Other human and animal figures representing a spectrum of imperial Chinese life, from the royal court to acrobats and even a lowly stablehand, have also been discovered.</p><p>The terracotta figures present many challenges for archaeologists and conservators. Most statues were broken over time and require painstaking work to reassemble. Ancient pigments once used to paint the statues disappear quickly after contact with light and air and require delicate handling. Scholars and conservators are working to preserve these priceless artifacts while uncovering their secrets.</p></aside><div class="share"> <h4>Share</h4><a href="http://www.twitter.com/share?url=http://field.mu/YVXr1&amp;text=Meet%20China%E2%80%99s%20First%20Emperor%20and%20His%20Terracotta%20Warriors%20@FieldMuseum%20%23TerracottaFM%20" class="twitter-share-button" target="_blank" data-network="twitter">Tweet this page</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://field.mu/YVXr1" class="facebook-sahre-button" target="_blank" data-network="facebook">Post to Facebook</a> </div></div></div><div class="detail bg" id="terracotta_army"><div class="container"><article> <img data-src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/terracotta/tcw-soldiers-1x-b659e07d569a20887e619daa40085f57.png" class="section-mast lazyload" alt="Terracotta Warrior General on exhibit at The Field Museum" /><h1 class="heading">An Army for<br /> the Afterlife</h1><h2 class="subheading">Meet the warriors who guarded a hidden empire</h2><div class="center"><p class="intro">Emperor Qin Shihuang’s tomb paid homage to his superior rank and position as the divine ruler of China. In addition to the magnificent treasures, the First Emperor’s tomb is also a hidden, underground empire. To guard it, Qin Shihuangdi commissioned a massive army of terracotta warriors.</p><div class="body"><p>Archaeologists estimate that there are about 8,000 terracotta figures in the areas surrounding Qin Shihuang's tomb, including horses, archers, charioteers, infantry, and generals. Most of the terracotta warriors are over six feet tall, substantially larger than the average citizen of the Qin empire at the time.</p><p>Each warrior is unique, with distinct faces that mirror the diversity of individuals who would have made up an actual army. The warriors were all painted by hand, enhancing the realism of the army as a whole. Each warrior was also stamped with the name of the foreman responsible for its creation, in order to track any mistakes.</p><p>Emperor Qin Shihuang spent a significant portion of his life preparing for the afterlife, and began construction on his tomb even before becoming Emperor. Archaeologists estimate the creation of the terracotta warriors alone to have taken over 10 years, which represents only a portion of the massive effort that went into creating Qin Shihuangdi’s tomb complex. No contemporary written reports of the tomb’s creation exist; the earliest written stories coming from over a century after the First Emperor’s death. Despite the large size of the site and its place in Chinese history, the terracotta army faded from memory and was effectively lost for centuries.</p></div><figure> <img src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/terracotta/tcw-process-1x-81d561ced91c7ef472837d6307c6811d.png" alt="Model" /> <figcaption>In order to make the the terracotta warriors, it is estimated that more than 1,000 convicts and conscripts were pressed into service, divided into groups, and overseen by the Emperor’s foremen. As depicted in this model, workers prepared massive amounts of clay for production and built each warrior by hand. Molds were used to form the feet and other body parts, and workers assembled the warriors from the ground up before taking the completed warrior to a giant kiln for firing.</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>It's interesting to think about how the First Emperor was able to rally enough labor and resources in a relatively short period of time to be able to accomplish this. Just think of the size of the population, and the number of people, including criminals and conscript labor, that he would have to bring in to build his tomb. Think about all the soldiers that are off on military campaigns, his court, and then the rest of the population involved with work like farming, which is required to feed all these people.</p><cite><span class="author">Lisa Niziolek</span> Boone Research Scientist</cite></blockquote></article><aside> <img data-src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/terracotta/tcw-small-section-2-king-1x-a1b1a78a7953341202a8f5d2581e3769.jpg" alt="Emperor Qin Shihuang Portrait" class="lazyload" /> <h2 class="heading">Who was Emperor Qin Shihuang?</h2><h3 class="subheading">Visionary to some, tyrant to others, China's First Emperor is shrouded in mystery</h3><p class="intro">Emperor Qin Shihuang came to power in 221 BC, ruling for almost a dozen eventful years until his death. Though no portraits survive of the First Emperor from his lifetime, he left a lasting legacy through the empire he built.</p><p>Under Qin Shihuangdi's rule, the many states and ethnic groups within his empire were united politically and economically. He built a network of roads to facilitate commerce and troop movements. Writing was standardized in the empire, and a single currency was adopted, the circular coin with a square hole, still associated with China today. These changes were unwelcome for many of Qin’s new subjects, who saw the Emperor not as a force for good, but as a despot imposing his will upon the people.</p><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>The Qin Empire is pivotal for Chinese history because it is the first time that a single ruler is able to defeat all of the remaining states and unify a huge amount of territory into an empire.

Accumulating and protecting possessions would ensure his proper place, and rank, in the afterlife.</p><div class="body"><p>The terracotta army is just one part of Qin Shihuangdi’s tomb. The First Emperor sought to secure his position as cosmic ruler in the afterlife by constructing an entire kingdom to surround his tomb. The mausoleum complex was built to mimic the Emperor’s world and was filled with precious goods, such as musical instruments, weapons, armor, jewelry, and models of warriors, officials, and entertainers, all intended to ensure the emperor’s place in the next world.</p><p>By examining what Qin Shihuangdi chose to keep for the next life, we can better understand how he lived his life on earth. The importance of horses is reflected in their prominence within the Emperor’s treasures. Horses are represented in the terracotta army, as well as in bronze figures, like the half-scale chariot seen above. Emperor Qin Shihuang paid particular attention to the equine aspects of his empire, going so far as to regulate the width of axles for chariots and horse carts as part of his regime’s standardization efforts. By controlling the width of axles, Qin Shihuangdi knew that new roads would be capable of accommodating all the empire’s travelers.</p></div><figure> <img src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/terracotta/tcw-ding-1x-9d994c7655170e23c83d50896ed314be.jpg" alt="Bronze Tripod Ding Vessel on exhibit at The Field Museum" /> <figcaption>Tripod vessels, like this bronze <em>ding</em> from the Warring States period (475–221 BC), are a common artifact in ancient Chinese graves. Archaeologists think this ding is from the Jin state and dates to the fifth century BC. The vessel weighs over 450 pounds. It was found in the same pit as some of Qin Shihuangdi’s terracotta strongmen and acrobats.<br /><br /><em>Ding</em> vessels can be seen as symbols of political power. As such, sumptuary laws were put in place to limit the number of vessels like this one a person could be buried with, so as to ensure that no one exceeded the privileges of his or her rank.</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>The conception of the afterlife was pretty elaborate. There were specific rituals that you would undertake to provide sacrifices of food and wine to support and feed the ancestors. So it was a fully formed, very detailed belief system, and among ruling families, elaborate burials were not uncommon. Now, that said, the tomb of the First Emperor is unique.
