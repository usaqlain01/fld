This central location made it ideal for the exchange of goods and ideas; boats connected the Cyclades to Asia Minor (today’s Turkey), mainland Greece, and Crete.</p><p>Control of these maritime trade routes, coupled with the quality of merchandise produced by local artisans, led to the rise of chiefs and a social hierarchy in the Cyclades. The female figurines excavated from wealthier burials represent high-status objects of this society. They were made of marble quarried from different islands in the Cyclades. Because the figurines share a number of features, there must have been cultural exchanges throughout the region.</p><p>The early Cycladic peoples did not use writing, so scholars look to the archaeological record for clues about this Bronze Age culture. (Early scripts appear in Crete and mainland Greece during later time periods.) The majority of figurines found in Cycladic graves are female and nude, strongly suggesting associations with fertility. But scholars disagree on exactly what the sculptures represent: mother-goddesses? priestesses or worshippers? Their exact function and meaning remain a mystery.</p></article><aside class="sidebar"><h3 class="aFewFacts">A few facts</h3><ol><li class="module"><figure class="detailImage height"> <img class="overallImage" data-src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-cycladic@1x-94a73577a449596ddc925385a1a96035.jpg" data-srcset="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-cycladic@1x-94a73577a449596ddc925385a1a96035.jpg 1x, /discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-cycladic@2x-c7e315eec9dff4334532072cd0029683.jpg 2x" alt="Female Figurine (Cycladic Sculpture)"><figcaption class="dimension">12 inches</figcaption></figure></li><li class="module"><h4>Time Period</h4><figure> <img class="timeline" src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/timeline-a35782bfefa77a2b2ed7994204cbedfc.svg"><figcaption>Amorgos, 2800–2300 BC</figcaption></figure></li><li class="etymology module"><h4>Etymology</h4><h5><span>marble</span></h5><ol><li><span>μάρμαρος <span class="transliterated"><span>(marmaros)</span></span></li><li><span>white shining stone</li></ol><p>Limestone that’s been transformed by heat and pressure within the earth into the rock used in monuments, Greek statues, and the facade of your favorite natural history museum.</p></li><li class="module"><h4>it's made of…</h4><p class="material marble"> <span class="materialImage" ></span> <span class="madeOf">marble</span></p><blockquote><p>Cycladic marble is very, very difficult to work.

Scribes recorded transactions on clay tablets in Linear B script. With its decipherment and attribution as an early form of the ancient Greek language, Mycenae can be considered the first-known “Greek” culture or civilization.</figcaption></figure><h3>Searching for Mythic Warriors</h3><p>Legend says that Agamemnon was the first to unite the Greeks in a common cause: avenging the honor of his brother Menelaus, whose wife—the beautiful Helen—had been abducted by a Trojan prince. It is easy to imagine Agamemnon marching his troops through the Lion Gate of Mycenae and off into battle.</p><p>Did he really exist? No one knows for sure. The Greek poet Homer imagined Agamemnon as the lord of Mycenae, long after the citadel itself had fallen to ruin. Heinrich Schliemann, the 19th-century German archaeologist, began excavating at Mycenae in 1875, convinced that the ruins were those of the city ruled by Agamemnon.</p><p>After uncovering a gold funerary mask, Schliemann is believed to have telegrammed the famous words, “I have gazed upon the eyes of Agamemnon.” But a short time later, Schliemann unearthed a second gold mask. Struck by its noble features, he decided he’d been wrong, and that this was the actual mask worn by the Greek hero and conqueror of Troy.</p><p>However, neither of these gold masks could have belonged to Agamemnon. The royal graves existed at least three centuries before the supposed time of the Trojan War. Despite that, Schliemann remains famous for discovering the site of the most powerful—and legendary—city in Bronze Age Greece.</article><aside class="sidebar"><h3 class="aFewFacts">A few facts</h3><ol><li class="module"><figure class="detailImage width"> <img class="overallImage" data-src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-agamemnon@1x-8822aaa441eecf9c524796ccce3f949d.jpg" data-srcset="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-agamemnon@1x-8822aaa441eecf9c524796ccce3f949d.jpg 1x, /discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-agamemnon@2x-4bf91935077e40798ce801ac6a460eda.jpg 2x" alt="“Mask of Agamemnon” (Modern replica of original death mask)"><figcaption class="dimension">10 inches</figcaption></figure></li><li class="module"><h4>Time Period</h4><figure> <img class="timeline" src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/timeline-a35782bfefa77a2b2ed7994204cbedfc.svg"><figcaption>Mycenae, 16th century BC (reproduction)</figcaption></figure></li><li class="etymology module"><h4>Etymology</h4><h5><span>archaeo</span><span class="secondary">logy</span></h5><ol><li><span>ἀρχαῖος</span><span class="secondary">λόγος <span class="transliterated"><span>(archaios</span><span class="secondary">logos)</span></span></li><li><span>ancient</span><span class="secondary">to study</li></ol><p>We got our word for the study of the remains of ancient cultures from… an ancient culture.</p></li><li class="module"><h4>it's made of…</h4><p class="material gold"> <span class="materialImage" title="© The Field Museum, GEO86518_3394Cd, Photographer John Weinstein."></span> <span class="madeOf">Gold</span></p><blockquote><p>In the Aegean, gold was rare.

Was he poor and blind as legend has suggested? Scholars debate if he was an itinerant minstrel or associated with a powerful court. One thing is certain: his major works, the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>, inspired and influenced generations of storytellers and writers who lived after him.</p><p>Both of these epic poems probably began as oral traditions, which were later written down and attributed to Homer, who lived during the eighth century BC. The <em>Iliad</em> tells the story of the Trojan War, traditionally dated to the 12th century BC—some 400 years before Homer.</p><p>Homer’s other major work, the <em>Odyssey</em>, is the sequel to the <em>Iliad</em>. It describes the adventures of the Greek hero, Odysseus, who overcame a number of challenges before returning home to the island of Ithaca after the Trojan War. His example of courage and determination continues to inspire us.</p><p>Homer’s epic poems—filled with tales of bravery, love, jealousy, and betrayal—are considered the earliest works of Western literature. They greatly influenced later writers, including Virgil and Dante, who continued the tradition of epic poetry. But Homer’s works also inspired countless novelists and playwrights, where the “hero’s journey” remains central to the narrative plot.</p></article><aside class="sidebar"><h3 class="aFewFacts">A few facts</h3><ol><li class="module"><figure class="detailImage height"> <img class="overallImage" data-src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-clay-vase@1x-e8d759191dd061c2337224778ff3e427.jpg" data-srcset="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-clay-vase@1x-e8d759191dd061c2337224778ff3e427.jpg 1x, /discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-clay-vase@2x-b143dc15ec72dc10026d0c3bc5218cd5.jpg 2x" alt="Achilles Avenging Patroclos (oil jar)"><figcaption class="dimension">13 inches</figcaption></figure></li><li class="module"><h4>Time Period</h4><figure> <img class="timeline" src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/timeline-a35782bfefa77a2b2ed7994204cbedfc.svg"><figcaption>Delos, 6th century BC</figcaption></figure></li><li class="etymology module"><h4>Etymology</h4><h5><span>epic</span></h5><ol><li><span>ἔπος <span class="transliterated"><span>(epos)</span></span></li><li><span>word or song</li></ol><p>Once a word for stories, songs, and poems—such as the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>—now used to describe things so awesome they deserve to have their praises sung.</p></li><li class="module"><h4>it's made of…</h4><p class="material ceramic"> <span class="materialImage" ></span> <span class="madeOf">Ceramic</span></p><p>Greek artisans painted vessels with a material that turned black during firing, leaving the background the red color of the clay.

At their heart, the games were a religious celebration. The athletes competed to honor Zeus, and a large temple was built for him at Olympia. The games were considered so sacred that violence between Greece’s often-feuding city-states was banned during the competition.</p><p>Although the events changed over time, the most common included running, wrestling, boxing, <em>pankration</em> (mixed martial arts), horse and chariot racing, and the pentathlon (five separate competitions over the course of a single day).</p><p>The winning athlete was crowned champion with a wreath. His exploits might be recounted in poems. His likeness could be carved in stone to memorialize his victories, then dedicated to Zeus at the temple.</p><p>This fragmentary sculpture of the “self-crowning athlete” might actually depict an athlete taking off his wreath and preparing to dedicate it to a god or goddess. But the carving has also been interpreted as a metaphor of the Athenian people who chose to govern themselves through an early system of democracy—in essence, to crown themselves as their own leaders and determine their own destinies. It is an ideal that lives on today in our own system of government and rule by the people.</p></article><aside class="sidebar"><h3 class="aFewFacts">A few facts</h3><ol><li class="module"><figure class="detailImage width"> <img class="overallImage" data-src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-Relief-of-youth@1x-3e43df7df448b4e21a699ba4c6f1ff82.jpg" data-srcset="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-Relief-of-youth@1x-3e43df7df448b4e21a699ba4c6f1ff82.jpg 1x, /discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-Relief-of-youth@2x-c7967f8f8369bf7295750c39af9ad8d1.jpg 2x" alt="Self-Crowning Athlete (Votive Relief)"><figcaption class="dimension">19 inches</figcaption></figure></li><li class="module"><h4>Time Period</h4><figure> <img class="timeline" src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/timeline-a35782bfefa77a2b2ed7994204cbedfc.svg"><figcaption>Sounion, circa 460 BC</figcaption></figure></li><li class="etymology module"><h4>Etymology</h4><h5><span>demo</span><span class="secondary">cracy</span></h5><ol><li><span>δῆμος</span><span class="secondary">κράτος <span class="transliterated"><span>(demos</span><span class="secondary">kratos)</span></span></li><li><span>the people</span><span class="secondary">power or rule</li></ol><p>Power to the people—the Greeks did it first (or at least, they put a name on it).</p></li><li><h4>Athenian Democracy</h4><p>Ancient Athens is considered the birthplace of Western democracy.

Here, patients spent the night in a dormitory—a precedent of today’s hospitals—and were treated for a variety of illnesses.</p><p>Physicians practiced under guidelines established by Hippocrates, often called “the father of Western medicine.” Hippocrates separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the gods, but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits.</p><p>Hippocrates also established ethical and professional guidelines for physicians, including the hippocratic oath, a version of which modern-day doctors still follow. The original oath began with this pledge:</p><p><em>I swear by Apollo the physician, and Asklepios the surgeon, likewise Hygeia and Panacea, and call all the gods and goddesses to witness, that I will observe and keep this underwritten oath, to the utmost of my power and judgment.</em></p><p>The legacy of ancient Greek medicine continues today with medical terms derived from the Greek language: hygienic, epidemic, and chronic to name just a few.</p></article><aside class="sidebar"><h3 class="aFewFacts">A few facts</h3><ol><li class="module"><figure class="detailImage width"> <img class="overallImage" data-src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-asklepios-relief@1x-9a57efb8df258641388da19274ec3ec7.jpg" data-srcset="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-asklepios-relief@1x-9a57efb8df258641388da19274ec3ec7.jpg 1x, /discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-asklepios-relief@2x-4a12944e0c3e59ce9308f2fb95471b89.jpg 2x" alt="Offering to Asklepios (Votive Relief)"><figcaption class="dimension">24 inches</figcaption></figure></li><li class="module"><h4>Time Period</h4><figure> <img class="timeline" src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/timeline-a35782bfefa77a2b2ed7994204cbedfc.svg"><figcaption>Loukou, 375–350 BC</figcaption></figure></li><li class="etymology module"><h4>Etymology</h4><h5><span>bio</span><span class="secondary">logy</span></h5><ol><li><span>βίος</span><span class="secondary">λόγος <span class="transliterated"><span>(bios</span><span class="secondary">logos)</span></span></li><li><span>life</span><span class="secondary">to study</li></ol><p>Aspiring doctors taking biology classes are studying life itself.

Philip II of Macedon unified Greece through a series of military victories, diplomatic alliances, and seven marriages. Philip’s son, Alexander the Great, would go even further. Conquering a large portion of the ancient world, he was seen as a god, and would be immortalized for all time.</p><p>Alexander was only 20 when his father was assassinated. Thanks, however, to his education under the Greek philosopher Aristotle and his training in the formidable Macedonian army, he was ready to lead. Within a single generation the ancient world was transformed as Alexander the Great conquered nations to create a vast, multi-ethnic empire.</p><p>During the course of his conquests, Alexander founded many cities—one of the most famous being Alexandria, Egypt—as bases of military control, but also as centers of Greek language, learning, and culture. It was through these cities that Greek civilization was disseminated through much of the known world.</p><p>Alexander called himself a son of Zeus, and many of his portraits depict him as a demi-god. Several portraits were produced by important painters and sculptors during Alexander’s lifetime and even after his death. Alexander’s political successors used copies of his image to associate themselves with the conqueror’s legend, power, and supposed divinity.</p></article><aside class="sidebar"><h3 class="aFewFacts">A few facts</h3><ol><li class="module"><figure class="detailImage height"> <img class="overallImage" data-src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-alexander@1x-1d3f8a3f1c9b6508b0cfa4b1c5984e47.jpg" data-srcset="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-alexander@1x-1d3f8a3f1c9b6508b0cfa4b1c5984e47.jpg 1x, /discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/detail/detail-alexander@2x-a1bbfdb09200f3b5a39f321d5641b622.jpg 2x" alt="Alexander as the God Pan (Sculpture)"><figcaption class="dimension">15 inches</figcaption></figure></li><li class="module"><h4>Time Period</h4><figure> <img class="timeline" src="/discover/on-exhibit/assets/greeks/timeline-a35782bfefa77a2b2ed7994204cbedfc.svg"><figcaption>Pella, 4th century BC</figcaption></figure></li><li class="etymology module"><h4>Etymology</h4><h5><span>cosmo</span><span class="secondary">politan</span></h5><ol><li><span>κόσμος</span><span class="secondary">πολίτης <span class="transliterated"><span>(kosmos</span><span class="secondary">polites)</span></span></li><li><span>world</span><span class="secondary">citizen</li></ol><p>When you lived in the largest ancient empire, it wasn’t hard to think of yourself as a classy, sophisticated “citizen of the world.” <span class="nobr">(No word</span> on whether the Greeks also cornered the market on women’s magazines with questionable dating tips.)</p></li><li><h4>Alexander’s Empire</h4><p>Alexander’s empire stretched some 4000 miles from the Adriatic Sea in the west to the Indus River in the east.
