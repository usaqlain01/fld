## Part 1: MediaElement.js
_HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` shim_

`MediaElement.js` wraps the HTML5 media API around Flash and/or Silverlight plugins for browsers that don't support HTML5 or don't support the media codecs you're using. 

	<script src="mediaelement.js"></script>
	<video src="myvideo.mp4" width="320" height="240"></video>
	
	<script>
	var v = document.getElementsByTagName("video")[0];
	new MediaElement(v, {success: function(media) {
		media.play();
	}});
	</script>

## Part 2: MediaElementPlayer.js

_HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` player_

A complete HTML/CSS audio/video player built on top  `MediaElement.js` and `jQuery`. Many great HTML5 players have a completely separate Flash UI in fallback mode, but MediaElementPlayer.js uses the same HTML/CSS for all players.

	<script src="jquery.js"></script>
	<script src="mediaelement.js"></script>
	<script src="mediaelementplayer.js"></script>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="mediaelementplayer.css" />

	<video id="v1" src="myvideo.mp4" width="320" height="240"></video>

	<script>
	$('video').mediaelementplayer();
	// OR
	new MediaElementPlayer('#v1');
	</script>
